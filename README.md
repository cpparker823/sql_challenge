# sql_challenge
Module 9 Challenge
In this assignment I took 6 databases and mapped a schema with primary and foriegn keys so I could run a myriad of queries. I started by mapping an Entity Relationship Diagram that can be viewed in the EmployeeSQL folder. The SQL code for contructing schema and tables can be found in the Empoyees_SQL file. A showcase of queries can be viewed in the DataAnalysis.sql file.

The task was to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remained of the employee database from that period were six CSV files. I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into the SQL database, and then was able to answer questions about the data. This project required SQL skills such as data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
